* Stream pipeline consists of
    - source
    - 0 or more intermediate operations
    - terminal operation
    
    source can come from Collections, lists, sets, arrays etc
    intermediate operations like map,filter,sort return stream so that we can chain multiple intermediate operations
    terminal operation like forEach,collect,reduce are void or return a non-stream result
    
Intermediate operations
    - anyMatch
    - distinct
    - filter
    - findFirst
    - flatmap
    - map
    - skip
    - sorted
    
Terminal operations
    - forEach
    - collect
    - count
    - max, min, reduce
